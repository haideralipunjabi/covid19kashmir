              <p><p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. &nbsp;In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p></p>

            <div class='message-body'>
              <p><p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don&rsquo;t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p></p>

            </div>
            <div class='message-body'>
              <p><p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. </p><p>WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><h3><hr />Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h3></div><p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.&nbsp; See previous answer on &ldquo;How does COVID-19 spread?&rdquo;</p><div><h3><hr />Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</h3></div><p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.&nbsp; WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><h3><hr />Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</h3></div><p>The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.&nbsp;</p></p>

              <p>What can I do to protect myself and prevent the&#160;spread of disease?</p>
            </div>
            <div class='message-body'>
              <p> <h3>Protection measures for everyone</h3><p></p><p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.</p><p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</p><p></p><ul type="disc"><li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.<br />Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</li><li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.<br />Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</li><li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.<br />Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</li><li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.<br />Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li><li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.<br />Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</li><li>Keep up to date on the      latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places &nbsp;&ndash; especially if you are an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.<br />Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:30px;"><br /></p><h3>Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading</h3><ul type="circle"><li>Follow the guidance      outlined above (Protection      measures for everyone) </li><li>Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.<br />Why? Avoiding contact       with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities       to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible       COVID-19 and other viruses.</li><li>If you develop fever, cough      and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due      to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and      tell your provider of any recent      travel or contact with travelers.<br />Why? Calling in advance will allow your       health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.       This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><div><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></p>

              <p> <p></p><p>The risk depends on where you &nbsp;are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. </p><p>For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.</p><p>COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It&rsquo;s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide. <br /></p><p>You can see these at&nbsp;<a href="/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/</a> </p></p>

            <div class='message-body'>
              <p><p><p>Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. </p>We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings. <p>Learn more about how to protect yourself at&nbsp;<a href="/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public" style="text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public</a></p></p></p>
